MECI - Minimum Energy Conical Intersection

What is a MECI?
  A MECI is a job that can find a minimum energy conical intersection between two states (i.e ground and S1) given a starting geometry. The job will constrain the energy difference between the specfied states (most likely S0 and S1) and travel along a energy surface until it is able to find a minmum in which the two states meet. 

Starting Geometries
  In order to start an MECI a intial guess geometry is required. Options for these guess geometries could be, last steps of an MEP, a surface hopping point, the middle point of a interpolated structure, and many others. The key to finding a starting geometry is to find something that could be or is close to what might be a MECI as then the job will have the highest likely hood of finding a accuract final geometry. 

Tips
  Try a lot of starting geometries. The starting geometry can darastically affect the MECI that is calculated so varying your own starting geometries will give you a better understading of what MECI the reaction contains. 
  Always check the structures generated by the MECI as it is running. Looking in the geo.molden file will show you every iterations geometrys. If the geometrys are heading in a direction that is unfavorable then cancel the job and change your starting geometry or certain input controls like the MAXstep.
