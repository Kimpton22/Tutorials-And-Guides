# Installing Pyflow 

#### Reference VERDE Paper: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpclett.9b02577
This Github page contains instructions for installing Pyflow: 
```
https://github.com/northeastern-rc/pyflow-installation-script
```

### Reminders:
- Make sure to have PyFlow.txt in the same directory as install_pyflow.sh.
- If you have not loaded Gaussian and GAMESS on your .bashrc, you must uncomment lines 58 to 66 in the install_pyflow.sh file

### Testing installation
#### Copy necessary scripts:
```
cp -r /work/lopez/share_from_Leticia/test-pyflow/ .
```

#### Test 1 - Creating molecules
```
python pymolgen-bench.py bench-MB 'CN(C1=CC=C(N=C2C=C([U])C(N(C)C)=CC2=[S+]3)C3=C1)C'
```

#### Test 2 - Set up Workflow
```
pyflow setup bench_round001 --config_file config-001.json
```

#### Test 3 - Submit Workflow
```
cp bench-MB/* bench_round001/unopt_pdbs/ cd bench_round001/ && pyflow begin --do_not_track
```

#### Test 4 - Check progress
```
pyflow progress
```

# Generating Molecules
#### Copy pymolgen script from VERDE
```
cp /work/lopez/share_from_Leticia/verde-pyflow/pymolgen.py .
```

#### Draw molecule on Chemdraw and select substituent location by using U for spacers

#### Changing spacers and terminals
Below are the spacers and terminal on the shared pymolgen script, if you need to change them, please edit the script

#### Generating molecule
1. Remember to source your pyflow environment and request resources
2. To generate pdb files, use the following command, replacing "SMILES" with the actual SMILES string.
   ```
   python pymolgen.py 'SMILES'
   ```

# Creating and submitting workflows
#### 1. Copy config files
   ```
    cp /work/lopez/share_from_Leticia/verde-pyflow/verde-config.json .
   ```

#### 2. Set up workflow: change XXX for the workflow name
   ```
pyflow setup XXX --config_file verde-config.json
   ```


Copy molecules generated to unopt_pdbs directory inside the workflow folder 
Limit of 1000 pdbs per workflow, conformers must be on the same workflow

Submit workflow 
		pyflow begin

Check progress
		pyflow progress


Scheme of performed jobs. Part 1 will be performed when generated molecules.

# Clean up workflow
Remove temporary files for failed jobs, for completed jobs them are automatically deleted
```
rm -r workflow*/*/*/failed/*.chk
```
```
rm -r workflow*/*/*/failed/*.rwf
```

## Extract results from Workflow using gather-results-withsp.py
1. Activate pyflow
```
conda activate pyflow
```
2. Run extraction script
```
python3 gather-results-withsp.py name-workflow
```

## Generate plots
### S0 Potentials + ColorMap showing wavelength
CSV details
  1. Need to be named S0.csv
  2. Collumn must have specific names: Oxi_S0,Red_S0,Wavelength

Usage
```
python3 plot-s0-colormap.py S0
```

Resulted plot
![plot_S0](https://github.com/adaogomesl/Leticia-LopezLab/assets/100699955/2a48e439-f486-4e13-8054-7ffd50c43fbd)

### Excited State Potentials + ColorMap showing wavelength
CSV details
  1. Need to be named S1.csv or T1.csv
  2. Collumn must have specific names: Oxi_S1,Red_S1
     
_in case of T1, replace S1 for T1_

Usage
```
python3 plot-scatter.py S1
```
Resulted plot
