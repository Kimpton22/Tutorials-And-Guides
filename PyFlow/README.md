# Installing Pyflow 

#### Reference VERDE Paper: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpclett.9b02577
This Github page contains instructions for installing Pyflow: 
```
https://github.com/northeastern-rc/pyflow-installation-script
```

### Reminders:
- Make sure to have PyFlow.txt in the same directory as install_pyflow.sh.
- If you have not loaded Gaussian and GAMESS on your .bashrc, you must uncomment lines 58 to 66 in the install_pyflow.sh file
- Run pyflow on your scratch

### Testing installation

#### Test 1 - Creating molecules
```
python pymolgen-bench.py bench-MB 'CN(C1=CC=C(N=C2C=C([U])C(N(C)C)=CC2=[S+]3)C3=C1)C'
```

#### Test 2 - Set up Workflow
```
pyflow setup bench_round001 --config_file config-001.json
```

#### Test 3 - Submit Workflow
```
cp bench-MB/* bench_round001/unopt_pdbs/ && cd bench_round001/ && pyflow begin --do_not_track
```

#### Test 4 - Check progress
```
pyflow progress
```

# Generating Molecules

#### Draw molecule on Chemdraw and select substituent location by using U for spacers

#### Changing spacers and terminals
Below are the spacers and terminal on the shared pymolgen script, if you need to change them, please edit the script

#### Generating molecule
1. Remember to source your pyflow environment and request resources
2. To generate pdb files, use the following command, replacing "SMILES" with the actual SMILES string.
   ```
   python pymolgen.py 'SMILES'
   ```
--- 

# Creating and submitting workflows

#### 1. Set up workflow: change XXX for the workflow name
   ```
pyflow setup XXX --config_file verde-config.json
   ```

#### 2. Copy molecules generated to unopt_pdbs directory inside the workflow folder 
_Limit of 1000 pdbs per workflow, conformers must be on the same workflow_

#### 3. Go inside workflow directory and submit the following command
   ```
pyflow begin
   ```
_If workflow with same name was submitted before, add --do_not_track flag_
 ```
pyflow begin --do_not_track flag
   ```

#### 4. Check progress
   ```
pyflow progress
   ```

Scheme of performed jobs. Part 1 will be performed when generating molecules.

If need to change jobs type, edit the config file. Details on the keywords on PyFlow GitHub: https://github.com/kuriba/PyFlow

# Clean up workflow
Remove temporary files for failed jobs, for completed jobs them are automatically deleted
```
rm -r workflow*/*/*/failed/*.chk
```
```
rm -r workflow*/*/*/failed/*.rwf
```

---
# Extract Potentials
#### 1. Copy extraction script to the same directory of the workflow directory - gather-results.py
```
cp /work/lopez/share_from_Leticia/verde-pyflow/gather-results.py .
```

#### 2. Extract the results - Replace workflow_name by the workflow directory name
_Reminders: Request resources and have PyFlow environment sourced_
```
python gather-results.py workflow_name
```

A CSV file will be generated with computed properties. Example of CSV is below:
