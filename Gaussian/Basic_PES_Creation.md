# Basic Potential Energy Surface (PES) Creation
Potential Energy Surfaces (PESs) are the bread and butter of most computational workflows. They describe how the energy of a molecule changes as a function of geometry, and are critical towards understanding the "allowed" (energetically favorable or plausible) and "unallowed" (energetically unfavorable or implausible) mechanisms. To create a PES of a reaction, you must first have the optimized reactant, product, and TS as well as energetic values for these structures. PES can be made with electronic energies, enthalpies, or free energies (it is recommended to use free energies where possible). The energies pulled from the .log files are absolute energies and in hartrees. It is not recommended to use these values directly. First, generate relative energies by assigning one structure (usually the reactant) as a relative 0 energy. Then take the energy of the TS and product and subtract the energy of the reactant. These are now relative energies, but are still in hartree and likely quite small. Convert these relative energies into another, more managable energy unit like kcal/mol (627.51 kcal = 1 hartree).

While this is a simple PES and could be described by an IRC, this small PES can be expanded upon to add down-stream reactions or alternative pathways. Often times this creates a larger PES web with multiple and branching surfaces which describe the relevant chemical transformations.
