# 1. Ground State (S0) Geometry Optimization
Ground state geometry optimizations in gaussian look to minimize the energy of a structure by varying geometric parameters in the molecule. It does this using first and sometimes second order derivatives. Geometry optimizations will continue until a) a stationary point is reached on the potential energy surface (PES) (stationary points includes TSs and minima) b) an error causes the job to end early or c) the maximum number of geometry iterations is reached.

## Files necessary
```.com or .gjf and .sh (not necessary if using python submit script)```

## Keywords
The are two mandatory keyword for geometry optimizations which are ```opt and freq=noraman```. ```opt``` ask gaussian to do a geometry optimization (searching for a minimum energy structure by default) and ```freq=noraman``` asks guassian to calculate the frequencies on the last structure generated by the optimization procedure. This last keyword is required to confirm the final structure as a minimum (more about that in the analysis).

### Optional Keywords


## Analysis
1. Check the end of the ```.log``` file to confirm it has the line ```Normal Termination of Gaussian 16```, which confirms that the job finished successfully. If you do not have this line at the end of your file that means that the calculations failed (see common error messages to resolve this).
2. Open the ```.log``` file with GaussView
   a.
