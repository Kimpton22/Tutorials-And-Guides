# 5. Time-Dependent DFT

# References

# What you need:
An optimized structure of the molecule of interest
Should have the same parameters (i.e. solvent and dispersion correction used from opt)

# Details on output
Oscillator strength (f) is related to the extinction coefficient and therefore can relate directly to absorption.
