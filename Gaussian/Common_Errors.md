Most errors in Gaussian end in the message: ```Error termination via Lnk1e```. This is the general "Oh no gaussian ran into a problem". Unfortunately, most gaussian error messages are not clear or easily diagnosable. This [https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Gaussian_error_messages] source has excellent documentation of the most common Gaussian error messages.
